      "Assistant: GraphRAG is an AI-based content interpretation and search capability that uses large language models (LLMs) to parse data and create a knowledge graph. It answers user questions about a user-provided private dataset by connecting information across large volumes of data. GraphRAG can handle complex queries that span many documents and thematic questions such as identifying top themes in a dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "GraphRAG is designed to support critical information discovery and analysis where the information required spans many documents, may be noisy, or mixed with misinformation. It is intended for use by trained users who apply responsible analytic approaches and critical reasoning, with human analysis needed to verify and augment its responses. The system is meant to be deployed with domain-specific text corpora.\n",
      "\n",
      "GraphRAG has been evaluated on accuracy of dataset representation, transparency and groundedness of responses, resilience to prompt and data corpus injection attacks, and low hallucination rates. It depends on well-constructed indexing for effective operation and is used in settings with domain sophistication and experience in information challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, GraphRAG enables advanced content search and interpretation by leveraging knowledge graph construction from large text datasets combined with LLM-based question answering, targeting complex and thematic information needs that go beyond simple keyword or vector-based search methods【4:1†demo.md】.\n"
