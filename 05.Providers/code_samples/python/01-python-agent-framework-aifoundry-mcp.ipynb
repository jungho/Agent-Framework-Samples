      "User: What is Microsoft Semantic Kernel?\n",
      "DocsAgent: Microsoft Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK designed to facilitate the integration and orchestration of artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially within .NET applications, although it also supports other programming languages such as Python and Java. This SDK serves as a framework for building AI applications, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI services, including those from OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Hugging Face.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features and Concepts\n",
      "- **Agents**: Semantic Kernel allows developers to create AI agents, which can automate processes, answer questions, and perform tasks with a degree of autonomy.\n",
      "- **Connections**: Provides interfaces to connect external AI services and data sources, streamlining the integration of LLMs into existing applications.\n",
      "- **Plugins**: Encapsulate functions that applications can use, which can either be semantic functions (AI prompts) or native functions (traditional code).\n",
      "- **Planning and Memory**: The SDK includes functionalities for orchestrating tasks (through a planner) and managing context (via memory features).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Benefits\n",
      "1. **Cohesive Solutions**: It helps integrate AI capabilities into applications seamlessly.\n",
      "2. **Reduced Complexity**: Provides abstractions to minimize the learning curve when working with different AI models.\n",
      "3. **Improved Reliability**: By fine-tuning prompts and planning tasks, developers can create a more controlled user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Getting Started\n",
      "To begin using Semantic Kernel, you can install the core library for your chosen programming language. For instance, in .NET, you can use NuGet to add the Semantic Kernel package:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "dotnet add package Microsoft.SemanticKernel\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
